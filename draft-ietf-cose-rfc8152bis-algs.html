<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">There has been an increased focus on small, constrained devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT).  One of the standards that has come out of this process is "Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)" <a href="#RFC7049" class="xref">[RFC7049]</a>.  CBOR extended the data model of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <a href="#RFC8259" class="xref">[RFC8259]</a> by allowing for binary data, among other changes.  CBOR is being adopted by several of the IETF working groups dealing with the IoT world as their encoding of data structures.  CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms of messages transport and implementation size and be a schema-free decoder.  A need exists to provide message security services for IoT, and using CBOR as the message-encoding format makes sense.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The core COSE specification consists of two documents.  <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]</a> contains the serialization structures and the procedures for using the different cryptographic algorithms.  This document provides for an initial set of algorithms that are then use with those structures.  Additional algorithms beyond what are in this document are defined elsewhere.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.1">The security strength of the signature is no greater than the minimum of the security strength associated with the bit length of the key and the security strength of the hash function.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.2">Note: Use of a deterministic signature technique is a good idea even when good random number generation exists.  Doing so both reduces the possibility of having the same value of 'k' in two signature operations and allows for reproducible signature values, which helps testing.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.3">There are two substitution attacks that can theoretically be mounted against the ECDSA signature algorithm.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Changing the curve used to validate the signature: If one changes the curve used to validate the signature, then potentially one could have two messages with the same signature, each computed under a different curve.  The only requirement on the new curve is that its order be the same as the old one and it be acceptable to the client.  An example would be to change from using the curve secp256r1 (aka P-256) to using secp256k1.  (Both are 256-bit curves.) We currently do not have any way to deal with this version of the attack except to restrict the overall set of curves that can be used.  </li>
<li>Change the hash function used to validate the signature: If one either has two different hash functions of the same length or can truncate a hash function down, then one could potentially find collisions between the hash functions rather than within a single hash function (for example, truncating SHA-512 to 256 bits might collide with a SHA-256 bit hash value). As the hash algorithm is part of the signature algorithm identifier, this attack is mitigated by including a signature algorithm identifier in the protected header.  </li>

<p><a href="#RFC8032" class="xref">[RFC8032]</a> describes the elliptic curve signature scheme Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).  In that document, the signature algorithm is instantiated using parameters for edwards25519 and edwards448 curves.  The document additionally describes two variants of the EdDSA algorithm: Pure EdDSA, where no hash function is applied to the content before signing, and HashEdDSA, where a hash function is applied to the content before signing and the result of that hash function is signed.  For EdDSA, the content to be signed (either the message or the pre-hash value) is processed twice inside of the signature algorithm.  For use with COSE, only the pure EdDSA version is used.  This is because it is not expected that extremely large contents are going to be needed and, based on the arrangement of the message structure, the entire message is going to need to be held in memory in order to create or verify a signature.  This means that there does not appear to be a need to be able to do block updates of the hash, followed by eliminating the message from memory.  Applications can provide the same features by defining the content of the message as a hash value and transporting the COSE object (with the hash value) and the content as separate items.  </p>

<ul>
<li>The key and nonce pair MUST be unique for every message encrypted. Note that the value of L influences the number of unique nonces.  </li>
<li>The total number of times the AES block cipher is used MUST NOT exceed 2^61 operations.

<p><a href="#RFC3610" class="xref">[RFC3610]</a> additionally calls out one other consideration of note.  It is possible to do a pre-computation attack against the algorithm in cases where portions of the plaintext are  highly predictable.  This reduces the security of the key size by half.  Ways to deal with this attack include adding a random portion to the nonce value and/or increasing the key size used.  Using a portion of the nonce for a random value will decrease the number of messages that a single key can be used for.  Increasing the key size may require more resources in the constrained device.

These algorithms are defined in Sections <a href="#direct-kdf" class="xref">6.1.2</a>, <a href="#ECDH" class="xref">6.3</a>, and <a href="#ECDH-wrap" class="xref">6.4</a>.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">The HKDF algorithm takes these inputs: </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>secret -- a shared value that is secret.  Secrets may be either previously shared or derived from operations like a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement.  </li>
<li>salt -- an optional value that is used to change the generation process.  The salt value can be either public or private.  If the salt is public and carried in the message, then the 'salt' algorithm header parameter defined in <a href="#HKDF_Alg_Params" class="xref">Table 9</a> is used.  While <a href="#RFC5869" class="xref">[RFC5869]</a> suggests that the length of the salt be the same as the length of the underlying hash value, any amount of salt will improve the security as different key values will be generated.  This parameter is protected by being included in the key computation and does not need to be separately authenticated.  The salt value does not need to be unique for every message sent.  </li>
<li>length -- the number of bytes of output that need to be generated.  </li>

Making this information specific to the context in which the material is going to be used ensures that the resulting material will always be tied to that usage.

<li>PRF -- The underlying pseudorandom function to be used in the HKDF algorithm.  The PRF is encoded into the HKDF algorithm selection.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">HKDF is defined to use HMAC as the underlying PRF.  However, it is possible to use other functions in the same construct to provide a different KDF that is more appropriate in the constrained world.  Specifically, one can use AES-CBC-MAC as the PRF for the expand step, but not for the extract step.  When using a good random shared secret of the correct length, the extract step can be skipped.  For the AES algorithm versions, the extract step is always skipped.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">The extract step cannot be skipped if the secret is not uniformly random, for example, if it is the result of an ECDH key agreement step.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.  The context information structure used here is based on that defined in <a href="#SP800-56A" class="xref">[SP800-56A]</a>.  By using CBOR for the encoding of the context information structure, we automatically get the same type and length separation of fields that is obtained by the use of ASN.1.  This means that there is no need to encode the lengths for the base elements, as it is done by the encoding used in JOSE (Section 4.6.2 of <a href="#RFC7518" class="xref">[RFC7518]</a>).   </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">The context information structure refers to PartyU and PartyV as the two parties that are doing the key derivation.  Unless the application protocol defines differently, we assign PartyU to the entity that is creating the message and PartyV to the entity that is receiving the message.  By doing this association, different keys will be derived for each direction as the context information is different in each direction.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">The context structure is built from information that is known to both entities.  This information can be obtained from a variety of sources: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fields can be defined by the application.  This is commonly used to assign fixed names to parties, but it can be used for other items such as nonces.  </li>
<li>Fields can be defined by usage of the output.  Examples of this are the algorithm and key size that are being generated.  </li>
<li>Fields can be defined by parameters from the message.  We define a set of parameters in <a href="#KDF_Context_Alg_Params" class="xref">Table 10</a> that can be used to carry the values associated with the context structure.  Examples of this are identities and nonce values.  These parameters are designed to be placed in the unprotected bucket of the recipient structure; they do not need to be in the protected bucket since they already are included in the cryptographic computation by virtue of being included in the context structure. </li>

<a href="#rfc.section.6.1.1.1">6.1.1.1.</a> Security Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.1.1.p.1">This recipient algorithm has several potential problems that need to be considered: </p>

<ul>
<li>These keys need to have some method to be regularly updated over time.  All of the content encryption algorithms specified in this document have limits on how many times a key can be used without significant loss of security.  </li>
<li>These keys need to be dedicated to a single algorithm.  There have been a number of attacks developed over time when a single key is used for multiple different algorithms.  One example of this is the use of a single key for both the CBC encryption mode and the CBC-MAC authentication mode.  </li>
<li>Breaking one message means all messages are broken.  If an adversary succeeds in determining the key for a single message, then the key for all messages is also determined.  </li>

The 'protected' field can be of non-zero length.  Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter of the context structure MUST be present.  The salt/nonce parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically.  The requirement is that it be a unique value for the shared secret in question.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.2">If the salt/nonce value is generated randomly, then it is suggested that the length of the random value be the same length as the hash function underlying HKDF.  While there is no way to guarantee that it will be unique, there is a high probability that it will be unique.  If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be guaranteed to be unique, and thus there is no length requirement.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.1.p.1">The shared secret needs to have some method to be regularly updated over time.  The shared secret is the basis of trust.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.3">6.3.</a> <a href="#ECDH" id="ECDH">Direct ECDH</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">The mathematics for ECDH can be found in <a href="#RFC6090" class="xref">[RFC6090]</a>.  In this document, the algorithm is extended to be used with the two curves defined in <a href="#RFC7748" class="xref">[RFC7748]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">ECDH is parameterized by the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Curve Type/Curve: The curve selected controls not only the size of the shared secret, but the mathematics for computing the shared secret.  The curve selected also controls how a point in the curve is represented and what happens for the identity points on the curve.  In this specification, we allow for a number of different curves to be used.  A set of curves are defined in <a href="#table-ec-curves" class="xref">Table 18</a>.  <br> The math used to obtain the computed secret is based on the curve selected and not on the ECDH algorithm.  For this reason, a new algorithm does not need to be defined for each of the curves.  </li>
<li>Computed Secret to Shared Secret: Once the computed secret is known, the resulting value needs to be converted to a byte string to run the KDF.  The x-coordinate is used for all of the curves defined in this document.  For curves X25519 and X448, the resulting value is used directly as it is a byte string of a known length.  For the P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves, the x-coordinate is run through the I2OSP function defined in <a href="#RFC8017" class="xref">[RFC8017]</a>, using the same computation for n as is defined in <a href="#ECDSA" class="xref">Section 2.1</a>.  </li>
<li>Ephemeral-Static or Static-Static: The key agreement process may be done using either a static or an ephemeral key for the sender's side.  When using ephemeral keys, the sender MUST generate a new ephemeral key for every key agreement operation.  The ephemeral key is placed in the 'ephemeral key' parameter and MUST be present for all algorithm identifiers that use ephemeral keys.  When using static keys, the sender MUST either generate a new random value or create a unique value.  For the KDFs used, this means either the 'salt' parameter for HKDF (<a href="#HKDF_Alg_Params" class="xref">Table 9</a>) or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter for the context structure (<a href="#KDF_Context_Alg_Params" class="xref">Table 10</a>) MUST be present (both can be present if desired). The value in the parameter MUST be unique for the pair of keys being used.  It is acceptable to use a global counter that is incremented for every static-static operation and use the resulting value.  When using static keys, the static key should be identified to the recipient.  The static key can be identified either by providing the key ('static key') or by providing a key identifier for the static key ('static key id').  Both of these parameters are defined in <a href="#table-ecdh-es-parameter-table" class="xref">Table 15</a>.  </li>
<li>Key Derivation Algorithm: The result of an ECDH key agreement process does not provide a uniformly random secret.  As such, it needs to be run through a KDF in order to produce a usable key.  Processing the secret through a KDF also allows for the introduction of context material: how the key is going to be used and one-time material for static-static key agreement.  All of the algorithms defined in this document use one of the HKDF algorithms defined in <a href="#HKDF" class="xref">Section 5.1</a> with the context structure defined in <a href="#context" class="xref">Section 5.2</a>.  </li>
<li>Key Wrap Algorithm: No key wrap algorithm is used.  This is represented in <a href="#table-ecdh-es-table" class="xref">Table 14</a> as 'none'.  The key size for the context structure is the content layer encryption algorithm size.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.3">COSE does not have an Ephemeral-Ephemeral version defined.  The reason for this is that COSE is not an an online protocol by itself and thus does not have a method to establish ephemeral secrets on both sides.  The expectation is that a protocol would establish the secrets for both sides, and then they would be used as static-static for the purposes of COSE, or that the protocol would generate a shared secret and a direct encryption would be used.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">There has been an attempt to limit the number of places where the document needs to impose restrictions on how the CBOR Encoder needs to work.  We have managed to narrow it down to the following restrictions: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The restriction applies to the encoding of the COSE_KDF_Context.  </li>
<li>Encoding MUST be done using definite lengths and the length of the  MUST be the minimum possible length.  This means that the integer 1 is encoded as "0x01" and not "0x1801".  </li>
<li>Applications MUST NOT generate messages with the same label used twice as a key in a single map.  Applications MUST NOT parse and process messages with the same label used twice as a key in a single map.  Applications can enforce the parse and process requirement by using parsers that will fail the parse step or by using parsers that will pass all keys to the application, and the application can perform the check for duplicate keys.  </li>

<h1 id="rfc.section.10">
<a href="#rfc.section.10">10.</a> <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">There are a number of security considerations that need to be taken into account by implementers of this specification.  The security considerations that are specific to an individual algorithm are placed next to the description of the algorithm.  While some considerations have been highlighted here, additional considerations may be found in the documents listed in the references.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">Implementations need to protect the private key material for any individuals.  There are some cases in this document that need to be highlighted on this issue.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Using the same key for two different algorithms can leak information about the key.  It is therefore recommended that keys be restricted to a single algorithm.  </li>
<li>Use of 'direct' as a recipient algorithm combined with a second recipient algorithm exposes the direct key to the second recipient.  </li>
<li>Several of the algorithms in this document have limits on the number of times that a key can be used without leaking information about the key.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">The use of ECDH and direct plus KDF (with no key wrap) will not directly lead to the private key being leaked; the one way function of the KDF will prevent that.  There is, however, a different issue that needs to be addressed.  Having two recipients requires that the CEK be shared between two recipients.  The second recipient therefore has a CEK that was derived from material that can be used for the weak proof of origin.  The second recipient could create a message using the same CEK and send it to the first recipient; the first recipient would, for either static-static ECDH or direct plus KDF, make an assumption that the CEK could be used for proof of origin even though it is from the wrong entity.  If the key wrap step is added, then no proof of origin is implied and this is not an issue.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">Although it has been mentioned before, the use of a single key for multiple algorithms has been demonstrated in some cases to leak information about a key, provide the opportunity for attackers to forge integrity tags, or gain information about encrypted content.  Binding a key to a single algorithm prevents these problems.  Key creators and key consumers are strongly encouraged not only to create new keys for each different algorithm, but to include that selection of algorithm in any distribution of key material and strictly enforce the matching of algorithms in the key structure to algorithms in the message structure.  In addition to checking that algorithms are correct, the key form needs to be checked as well.  Do not use an 'EC2' key where an 'OKP' key is expected.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.5">Before using a key for transmission, or before acting on information received, a trust decision on a key needs to be made.  Is the data or action something that the entity associated with the key has a right to see or a right to request? A number of factors are associated with this trust decision.  Some of the ones that are highlighted here are: </p>

<ul>
<li>What are the permissions associated with the key owner?</li>
<li>Is the cryptographic algorithm acceptable in the current context?</li>
<li>Have the restrictions associated with the key, such as algorithm or freshness, been checked and are they correct?</li>
<li>Is the request something that is reasonable, given the current state of the application?</li>
<li>Have any security considerations that are part of the message been enforced (as specified by the application or 'crit' parameter)?</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.6">There are a large number of algorithms presented in this document that use nonce values.  For all of the nonces defined in this document, there is some type of restriction on the nonce being a unique value either for a key or for some other conditions.  In all of these cases, there is no known requirement on the nonce being both unique and unpredictable; under these circumstances, it's reasonable to use a counter for creation of the nonce.  In cases where one wants the pattern of the nonce to be unpredictable as well as unique, one can use a key created for that purpose and encrypt the counter to produce the nonce value.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.7">One area that has been starting to get exposure is doing traffic analysis of encrypted messages based on the length of the message.  This specification does not provide for a uniform method of providing padding as part of the message structure.  An observer can distinguish between two different strings (for example, 'YES' and 'NO') based on the length for all of the content encryption algorithms that are defined in this document.  This means that it is up to the applications to document how content padding is to be done in order to prevent or discourage such analysis.  (For example, the strings could be defined as 'YES' and 'NO '.) </p>
