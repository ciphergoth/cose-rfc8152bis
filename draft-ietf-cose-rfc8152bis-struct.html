<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">There has been an increased focus on small, constrained devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT).  One of the standards that has come out of this process is "Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)" <a href="#RFC7049" class="xref">[RFC7049]</a>.  CBOR extended the data model of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <a href="#RFC8259" class="xref">[RFC8259]</a> by allowing for binary data, among other changes.  CBOR has been adopted by several of the IETF working groups dealing with the IoT world as their encoding of data structures.  CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms of messages transport and implementation size and be a schema-free decoder.  A need exists to provide message security services for IoT, and using CBOR as the message-encoding format makes sense.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The JOSE working group produced a set of documents <a href="#RFC7515" class="xref">[RFC7515]</a> <a href="#RFC7516" class="xref">[RFC7516]</a> <a href="#RFC7517" class="xref">[RFC7517]</a> <a href="#RFC7518" class="xref">[RFC7518]</a> using JSON that specified how to process encryption, signatures, and Message Authentication Code (MAC) operations and how to encode keys using JSON.  This document along with <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a> defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) standard, which does the same thing for the CBOR encoding format.  While there is a strong attempt to keep the flavor of the original JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) documents, two considerations are taken into account: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>CBOR has capabilities that are not present in JSON and are appropriate to use.  One example of this is the fact that CBOR has a method of encoding binary directly without first converting it into a base64-encoded string.  </li>
<li>COSE is not a direct copy of the JOSE specification.  In the process of creating COSE, decisions that were made for JOSE were re-examined.  In many cases, different results were decided on as the criteria were not always the same.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This document contains: </p>

<ul>
<li>The description of the structure for the CBOR objects which are transmitted over the wire.  Two objects are defined for encryption, signing and message authentication.  One object is defined for transporting keys and one for transporting groups of keys.  </li>
<li>The procedures used to build the inputs to the cryptographic functions required for each of the structures.  </li>
<li>A starting set of attributes that apply to the different security objects.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document does not contain the rules and procedures for using specific cryptographic algorithms.  Details on specific algorithms can be found in <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a> and <a href="#RFC8230" class="xref">[RFC8230]</a>.  Details for additional algorithms are expected to be defined in future documents.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">One feature that is present in CMS <a href="#RFC5652" class="xref">[RFC5652]</a> that is not present in this standard is a digest structure.  This omission is deliberate.  It is better for the structure to be defined in each document as different protocols will want to include a different set of fields as part of the structure.  While an algorithm identifier and the digesst value are going to be common to all applications, the two values may not always be adjacent as the algorithm could be defined once with multiple values.  Applications may additionally want to define additional data fields as part of the stucture.  A common structure is going to include a URI or other pointer to where the data that is being hashed is kept, allowing this to be application specific.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Define a single top message structure so that encrypted, signed, and MACed messages can easily be identified and still have a consistent view.  </li>
<li>Signed messages distinguish between the protected and unprotected parameters that relate to the content from those that relate to the signature. </li>
<li>MACed messages are separated from signed messages.  </li>
<li>MACed messages have the ability to use the same set of recipient algorithms as enveloped messages for obtaining the MAC authentication key.  </li>
<li>Use binary encodings for binary data rather than base64url encodings.  </li>
<li>Combine the authentication tag for encryption algorithms with the ciphertext.  </li>
<li>The set of cryptographic algorithms has been expanded in some directions and trimmed in others.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">[RFC2119]</a> <a href="#RFC8174" class="xref">[RFC8174]</a> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.4">1.4.</a> <a href="#cbor-grammar" id="cbor-grammar">CBOR Grammar</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.1">There was not a standard CBOR grammar available when COSE was originally written.  For that reason the CBOR structures defined here are described in prose.  Since that time CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) <a href="#RFC8610" class="xref">[RFC8610]</a> has been published as an RFC.  The CBOR grammar presented in this document is compatible with CDDL.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.2">The document was developed by first working on the grammar and then developing the prose to go with it.  An artifact of this is that the prose was written using the primitive type strings defined by CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) <a href="#RFC8610" class="xref">[RFC8610]</a>.  In this specification, the following primitive types are used: </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>any -- non-specific value that permits all CBOR values to be placed here.</li>
<li>bool -- a boolean value (true: major type 7, value 21; false: major type 7, value 20).</li>
<li>bstr -- byte string (major type 2).</li>
<li>int -- an unsigned integer or a negative integer.</li>
<li>nil -- a null value (major type 7, value 22).</li>
<li>nint -- a negative integer (major type 1).</li>
<li>tstr -- a UTF-8 text string (major type 3).</li>
<li>uint -- an unsigned integer (major type 0).</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.3">Two syntaxes from CDDL appear in this document as shorthand.  These are: </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>FOO / BAR -- indicates that either FOO or BAR can appear here.</li>
<li>[+ FOO] -- indicates that the type FOO appears one or more times in an array.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.4">Two of the constraints defined by CDDL are also used in this document.  These are: </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>type1 .cbor type2 -- indicates that the contents of type1, usually bstr, contains a value of type2.</li>
<li>type1 .size integer -- indicates that the contents of type1 is integer bytes long</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.5">As well as the prose description, a version of a CBOR grammar is presented in CDDL.  The CDDL grammar is informational; the prose description is normative.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.6">The collected CDDL can be extracted from the XML version of this document via the following XPath expression below.  (Depending on the XPath evaluator one is using, it may be necessary to deal with &amp;gt; as an entity.) </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.5.p.1">In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a string.  In COSE, we use strings, negative integers, and unsigned integers as map keys.  The integers are used for compactness of encoding and easy comparison.  The inclusion of strings allows for an additional range of short encoded values to be used as well.  Since the word "key" is mainly used in its other meaning, as a cryptographic key, we use the term "label" for this usage as a map key.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.5.p.2">The presence of a label in a COSE map that is not a string or an integer is an error.  Applications can either fail processing or process messages by ignoring incorrect labels; however, they MUST NOT create messages with incorrect labels.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.1">In this document, we use the following terminology: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.2">Byte is a synonym for octet.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.3">Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use in constrained systems.  It is defined in <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.4">Authenticated Encryption (AE) <a href="#RFC5116" class="xref">[RFC5116]</a> algorithms are those encryption algorithms that provide an authentication check of the contents algorithm with the encryption service.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.5">Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) <a href="#RFC5116" class="xref">[RFC5116]</a> algorithms provide the same content authentication service as AE algorithms, but they additionally provide for authentication of non-encrypted data as well.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.6">Context is used throughout the document to represent information that is not part of the COSE message.  Information which is part of the context can come from several different sources including: Protocol interactions, associated key structures and program configuration.  The context to use can be implicit, identified using the 'kid context' header field defined in <a href="#RFC8613" class="xref">[RFC8613]</a>, or identified by a protocol specific identifier.  Context should generally be included in the cryptographic configuration, for more details see <a href="#Extern_AAD" class="xref">Section 4.3</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#the-cosemsg-structure" id="the-cosemsg-structure">Basic COSE Structure</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The COSE object structure is designed so that there can be a large amount of common code when parsing and processing the different types of security messages.  All of the message structures are built on the CBOR array type.  The first three elements of the array always contain the same information: </p>

<ol>
<li>The set of protected header parameters wrapped in a bstr.</li>
<li>The set of unprotected header parameters as a map.</li>
<li>The content of the message.  The content is either the plaintext or the ciphertext as appropriate.  The content may be detached (i.e. transported separately from the COSE structure), but the location is still used.  The content is wrapped in a bstr when present and is a nil value when detached.  </li>
</ol>

<p> Elements after this point are dependent on the specific message type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">COSE messages are built using the concept of layers to separate different types of cryptographic concepts.  As an example of how this works, consider the COSE_Encrypt message (<a href="#EnvelopedData" class="xref">Section 6.1</a>).  This message type is broken into two layers: the content layer and the recipient layer.  In the content layer, the plaintext is encrypted and information about the encrypted message is placed.  In the recipient layer, the content encryption key (CEK) is encrypted and information about how it is encrypted for each recipient is placed.  A single layer version of the encryption message COSE_Encrypt0 (<a href="#EnvelopedData0" class="xref">Section 6.2</a>) is provided for cases where the CEK is pre-shared.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Identification of which type of message has been presented is done by the following methods: </p>

<ol>
<li>The specific message type is known from the context.  This may be defined by a marker in the containing structure or by restrictions specified by the application protocol.  </li>
<li>The message type is identified by a CBOR tag.  Messages with a CBOR tag are known in this specification as tagged messages, while those without the CBOR tag are known as untagged messages.  This document defines a CBOR tag for each of the message structures.  These tags can be found in <a href="#CBOR-Tags" class="xref">Table 1</a>.  </li>
<li>When a COSE object is carried in a media type of 'application/cose', the optional parameter 'cose-type' can be used to identify the embedded object.  The parameter is OPTIONAL if the tagged version of the structure is used.  The parameter is REQUIRED if the untagged version of the structure is used.  The value to use with the parameter for each of the structures can be found in <a href="#CBOR-Tags" class="xref">Table 1</a>.  </li>
<li>When a COSE object is carried as a CoAP payload, the CoAP Content-Format Option can be used to identify the message content.  The CoAP Content-Format values can be found in <a href="#CoAP_content_type" class="xref">Table 2</a>.  The CBOR tag for the message structure is not required as each security message is uniquely identified.  </li>

This bucket MUST be empty if it is not going to be included in a cryptographic computation.  This bucket is encoded in the message as a binary object.  This value is obtained by CBOR encoding the protected map and wrapping it in a bstr object.  Senders SHOULD encode a zero-length map as a zero-length byte string rather than as a zero-length map (encoded as h'a0').  The zero-length binary encoding is preferred because it is both shorter and the version used in the serialization structures for cryptographic computation.  After encoding the map, the value is wrapped in the binary object.  Recipients MUST accept both a zero-length binary value and a zero-length map encoded in the binary value.  The wrapping allows for the encoding of the protected map to be transported with a greater chance that it will not be altered in transit.  (Badly behaved intermediates could decode and re-encode, but this will result in a failure to verify unless the re-encoded byte string is identical to the decoded byte string.) This avoids the problem of all parties needing to be able to do a common canonical encoding.  </dd>

This support is provided by AEAD algorithms or construction (COSE_Sign, COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac, and COSE_Mac0).  This authentication can be done either by placing the parameter in the protected header bucket or as part of the externally supplied data.

<dd style="margin-left: 8">The parameter is used to indicate which protected header labels an application that is processing a message is required to understand.  Parameters defined in this document do not need to be included as they should be understood by all implementations.  When present, this parameter MUST be placed in the protected header bucket.  The array MUST have at least one value in it.  <br> Not all labels need to be included in the 'crit' parameter.  The rules for deciding which header labels are placed in the array are: <ul>
<li>Integer labels in the range of 0 to 7 SHOULD be omitted.</li>
<li>Integer labels in the range -1 to -128 can be omitted as they are algorithm dependent.  If an application can correctly process an algorithm, it can be assumed that it will correctly process all of the common parameters associated with that algorithm.  Integer labels in the range -129 to -65536 SHOULD be included as these would be less common parameters that might not be generally supported.  </li>
<li>Labels for parameters required for an application MAY be omitted.  Applications should have a statement if the label can be omitted.  </li>
</ul>
<p> The header parameter values indicated by 'crit' can be processed by either the security library code or an application using a security library; the only requirement is that the parameter is processed.  If the 'crit' value list includes a value for which the parameter is not in the protected bucket, this is a fatal error in processing the message.  </p>

The internal structure of 'kid' values is not defined and cannot be relied on by applications.  Key identifier values are hints about which key to use.  This is not a security-critical field.  For this reason, it can be placed in the unprotected headers bucket.  </dd>
<dt>IV:</dt>

An example of a parameter about the content is the content type.  Examples of parameters about the signature would be the algorithm and key used to create the signature and counter signatures.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">RFC 5652 indicates that: </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>When more than one signature is present, the successful validation of one signature associated with a given signer is usually treated as a successful signature by that signer.  However, there are some application environments where other rules are needed.  An application that employs a rule other than one valid signature for each signer must specify those rules.  Also, where simple matching of the signer identifier is not sufficient to determine whether the signatures were generated by the same signer, the application specification must describe how to determine which signatures were generated by the same signer.  Support for different communities of recipients is the primary reason that signers choose to include more than one signature.</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">For example, the COSE_Sign structure might include signatures generated with the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) <a href="#RFC8032" class="xref">[RFC8032]</a> and with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) <a href="#DSS" class="xref">[DSS]</a>.

The primary reason for supporting this can be seen by looking at the CoAP message structure <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a>, where the facility exists for options to be carried before the payload.  Examples of data that can be placed in this location would be the CoAP code or CoAP options.  If the data is in the header section, then it is available for proxies to help in performing its operations.  For example, the Accept Option can be used by a proxy to determine if an appropriate value is in the proxy's cache.  But the sender can cause a failure at the server if a proxy, or an attacker, changes the set of accept values by including the field in the application supplied data.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">This document describes the process for using a byte array of externally supplied authenticated data; the method of constructing the byte array is a function of the application.  Applications that use this feature need to define how the externally supplied authenticated data is to be constructed.  Such a construction needs to take into account the following issues: </p>

<ul>
<li>If multiple items are included, applications need to ensure that the same byte string cannot produced if there are different inputs.  This would occur by appending the strings 'AB' and 'CDE' or by appending the strings 'ABC' and 'DE'.  This is usually addressed by making fields a fixed width and/or encoding the length of the field as part of the output.  Using options from CoAP <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a> as an example, these fields use a TLV structure so they can be concatenated without any problems.  </li>
<li>If multiple items are included, an order for the items needs to be defined.  Using options from CoAP as an example, an application could state that the fields are to be ordered by the option number.  </li>
<li>Applications need to ensure that the byte string is going to be the same on both sides.  Using options from CoAP might give a problem if the same relative numbering is kept.  An intermediate node could insert or remove an option, changing how the relative number is done.  An application would need to specify that the relative number must be re-encoded to be relative only to the options that are in the external data.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">COSE supports two different forms for counter signatures.  Full countersignatures use the structure COSE_Countersign.  This is same structure as COSE_Signature and thus it can have protected attributes, chained countersignatures and information about identifying the key.  Abbreviated countersignatures use the structure COSE_Countersign1.  This structure only contains the signature value and nothing else.  The structures cannot be converted between each other; as the signature computation includes a parameter identifying which structure is being used, the converted structure will fail signature validation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">COSE was designed for uniformity in how the data strutures are specified.  One result of this is that for COSE one can expand the concept of countersignatures beyond just the idea of signing a signature to being able to sign most of the structures without having to create a new signing layer.  When creating a countersignature, one needs to be clear about the security properties that result.  When done on a COSE_Signature, the normal countersignature semantics are preserved.  That is the countersignature makes a statement about the existence of a signature and, when used as a timestamp, a time point at which the signature exists.  When done on a COSE_Mac or a COSE_Mac0, one effectively upgrades the MAC operation to a sginature operation.  When done on a COSE_Encrypt or COSE_Encrypt0, the existence of the encrypted data is attested to.  It should be noted that there is a big difference between attesting to the encrypted data as opposed to attesting to the unencrypted data.  If the latter is what is desired, then one needs to apply a signature to the data and then encrypt that.  It is always possible to construct cases where the decryption is successful, while providing completely different answers by using a different key.  This situation is not detectable by a countersignature on the encrypted data.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">The COSE_Countersignature structure allows for the same set of capabilities of a COSE_Signature.  This means that all of the capabilities of a signature are duplicated with this structure.  Specifically, the countersigner does not need to be related to the producer of what is being counter signed as key and algorithm identification can be placed in the countersignature attributes.  This also means that the countersignature can itself be countersigned.  This is a feature required by protocols such as long-term archiving services.

<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> Taxonomy of Algorithms used by COSE</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">In this section, a taxonomy of the different algorithm types that can be used in COSE is laid out.  This taxonomy should not be considered to be exhaustive as there are new algorithm structures that could be found or are not known to the author.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.1">9.1.</a> <a href="#SigAlgs" id="SigAlgs">Signature Algorithms</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">There are two signature algorithm schemes.  The first is signature with appendix.  In this scheme, the message content is processed and a signature is produced; the signature is called the appendix.  This is the scheme used by algorithms such as ECDSA and the RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS).  (In fact, the SSA in RSASSA-PSS stands for Signature Scheme with Appendix.) </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.2">The signature functions for this scheme are: </p>
<pre>
signature = Sign(message content, key)

valid = Verification(message content, key, signature)
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.3">The second scheme is signature with message recovery (an example of such an algorithm is <a href="#PVSig" class="xref">[PVSig]</a>). In this scheme, the message content is processed, but part of it is included in the signature.  Moving bytes of the message content into the signature allows for smaller signatures; the signature size is still potentially large, but the message content has shrunk.  This has implications for systems implementing these algorithms and for applications that use them.  The first is that the message content is not fully available until after a signature has been validated.  Until that point, the part of the message contained inside of the signature is unrecoverable.  The second is that the security analysis of the strength of the signature is very much based on the structure of the message content.  Messages that are highly predictable require additional randomness to be supplied as part of the signature process.  In the worst case, it becomes the same as doing a signature with appendix.  Finally, in the event that multiple signatures are applied to a message, all of the signature algorithms are going to be required to consume the same number of bytes of message content.  This means that the mixing of the different schemes in a single message is not supported, and if a recovery signature scheme is used, then the same amount of content needs to be consumed by all of the signatures.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.4">The signature functions for this scheme are: </p>
<pre>
signature, message sent = Sign(message content, key)

valid, message content = Verification(message sent, key, signature)
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.5">Signature algorithms are used with the COSE_Signature and COSE_Sign1 structures.  At this time, only signatures with appendixes are defined for use with COSE; however, considerable interest has been expressed in using a signature with message recovery algorithm due to the effective size reduction that is possible.  Implementations will need to keep this in mind for later possible integration.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.2">9.2.</a> Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithms</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.1">Message Authentication Codes (MACs) provide data authentication and integrity protection.  They provide either no or very limited data origination.  A MAC, for example, cannot be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third party.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.2">MACs use the same scheme as signature with appendix algorithms.  The message content is processed and an authentication code is produced.  The authentication code is frequently called a tag.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.3">The MAC functions are: </p>
<pre>
tag = MAC_Create(message content, key)

valid = MAC_Verify(message content, key, tag)
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.4">MAC algorithms can be based on either a block cipher algorithm (i.e., AES-MAC) or a hash algorithm (i.e., a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)).  <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a> defines a MAC algorithm using each of these constructions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.5">MAC algorithms are used in the COSE_Mac and COSE_Mac0 structures.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.3">9.3.</a> Content Encryption Algorithms</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">Content encryption algorithms provide data confidentiality for potentially large blocks of data using a symmetric key.  They provide integrity on the data that was encrypted; however, they provide either no or very limited data origination.  (One cannot, for example, be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third party.) The ability to provide data origination is linked to how the CEK is obtained.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">COSE restricts the set of legal content encryption algorithms to those that support authentication both of the content and additional data.  The encryption process will generate some type of authentication value, but that value may be either explicit or implicit in terms of the algorithm definition.  For simplicity's sake, the authentication code will normally be defined as being appended to the ciphertext stream.  The encryption functions are: </p>
<pre>
ciphertext = Encrypt(message content, key, additional data)

valid, message content = Decrypt(ciphertext, key, additional data)
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">Most AEAD algorithms are logically defined as returning the message content only if the decryption is valid.  Many but not all implementations will follow this convention.  The message content MUST NOT be used if the decryption does not validate.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.4">These algorithms are used in COSE_Encrypt and COSE_Encrypt0.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.4">9.4.</a> Key Derivation Functions (KDFs)</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">KDFs are used to take some secret value and generate a different one.  The secret value comes in three flavors: </p>

<ul>
<li>Secrets that are uniformly random:  This is the type of secret that is created by a good random number generator.</li>
<li>Secrets that are not uniformly random: This is type of secret that is created by operations like key agreement.</li>
<li>Secrets that are not random: This is the type of secret that people generate for things like passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.2">General KDFs work well with the first type of secret, can do reasonably well with the second type of secret, and generally do poorly with the last type of secret.  Functions like PBES2 <a href="#RFC8018" class="xref">[RFC8018]</a> need to be used for non-random secrets.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.3">The same KDF can be set up to deal with the first two types of secrets in a different way.  The KDF defined in section 5.1 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a> is such a function.  This is reflected in the set of algorithms defined around the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.4">When using KDFs, one component that is included is context information.  Context information is used to allow for different keying information to be derived from the same secret.  The use of context-based keying material is considered to be a good security practice.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">Content key distribution methods (recipient algorithms) can be defined into a number of different classes.  COSE has the ability to support many classes of recipient algorithms.  In this section, a number of classes are listed.  The names of the recipient algorithm classes used here are the same as those defined in <a href="#RFC7516" class="xref">[RFC7516]</a>.  Other specifications use different terms for the recipient algorithm classes or do not support some of the recipient algorithm classes.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.5.1.p.1">The direct encryption class algorithms share a secret between the sender and the recipient that is used either directly or after manipulation as the CEK.  When direct encryption mode is used, it MUST be the only mode used on the message.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.2.p.1">In key wrap mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the recipient.  All of the currently defined key wrap algorithms for COSE are AE algorithms.  Key wrap mode is considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any capability for doing random key generation.  This is because the shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data that has some degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.  The use of key wrap loses the weak data origination that is provided by the direct encryption algorithms.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.2.p.2">The COSE_Encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The 'protected' field MUST be absent if the key wrap algorithm is an AE algorithm.  </li>
<li>The 'recipients' field is normally absent, but can be used.  Applications MUST deal with a recipient field being present that has an unsupported algorthms, not being able to decrypt that recipient is an acceptable way of dealing with it.  Failing to process the message is not an acceptable way of dealing with it.  </li>
<li>The plaintext to be encrypted is the key from next layer down (usually the content layer).  </li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.3.p.1">Key transport mode is also called key encryption mode in some standards.  Key transport mode differs from key wrap mode in that it uses an asymmetric encryption algorithm rather than a symmetric encryption algorithm to protect the key.  A set of key transport algorithms are defined in <a href="#RFC8230" class="xref">[RFC8230]</a>.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.9.5.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.5.4">9.5.4.</a> Direct Key Agreement</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.4.p.1">The 'direct key agreement' class of recipient algorithms uses a key agreement method to create a shared secret.  A KDF is then applied to the shared secret to derive a key to be used in protecting the data.  This key is normally used as a CEK or MAC key, but could be used for other purposes if more than two layers are in use (see <a href="#three-layer" class="xref">Appendix B</a>).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.4.p.2">The most commonly used key agreement algorithm is Diffie-Hellman, but other variants exist.  Since COSE is designed for a store and forward environment rather than an online environment, many of the DH variants cannot be used as the receiver of the message cannot provide any dynamic key material.  One side effect of this is that perfect forward secrecy (see <a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a>) is not achievable.  A static key will always be used for the receiver of the COSE object.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.4.p.3">Two variants of DH that are supported are: </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>Ephemeral-Static (ES) DH: where the sender of the message creates a one-time DH key and uses a static key for the recipient.  The use of the ephemeral sender key means that no additional random input is needed as this is randomly generated for each message.  </li>
<li>Static-Static (SS) DH: where a static key is used for both the sender and the recipient.  The use of static keys allows for the recipient to get a weak version of data origination for the message.  When static-static key agreement is used, then some piece of unique data for the KDF is required to ensure that a different key is created for each message.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.4.p.4">When direct key agreement mode is used, there MUST be only one recipient in the message.  This method creates the key directly, and that makes it difficult to mix with additional recipients.  If multiple recipients are needed, then the version with key wrap needs to be used.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.11">11.</a> Application Profiling Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">This document is designed to provide a set of security services, but not impose algorithm implementation requirements for specific usage.  The interoperability requirements are provided for how each of the individual services are used and how the algorithms are to be used for interoperability.  The requirements about which algorithms and which services are needed are deferred to each application.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">An example of a profile can be found in <a href="#RFC8613" class="xref">[RFC8613]</a> where one was developed for carrying content in combination with CoAP headers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">It is intended that a profile of this document be created that defines the interoperability requirements for that specific application.  This section provides a set of guidelines and topics that need to be considered when profiling this document.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Applications need to determine the set of messages defined in this document that they will be using.  The set of messages corresponds fairly directly to the set of security services that are needed and to the security levels needed.  </li>
<li>Applications may define new header parameters for a specific purpose.  Applications will often times select specific header parameters to use or not to use.  For example, an application would normally state a preference for using either the IV or the Partial IV parameter.  If the Partial IV parameter is specified, then the application also needs to define how the fixed portion of the IV is determined.  </li>
<li>When applications use externally defined authenticated data, they need to define how that data is encoded.  This document assumes that the data will be provided as a byte string.  More information can be found in <a href="#Extern_AAD" class="xref">Section 4.3</a>.  </li>
<li>Applications need to determine the set of security algorithms that are to be used.  When selecting the algorithms to be used as the mandatory-to-implement set, consideration should be given to choosing different types of algorithms when two are chosen for a specific purpose.  An example of this would be choosing HMAC-SHA512 and AES-CMAC as different MAC algorithms; the construction is vastly different between these two algorithms.  This means that a weakening of one algorithm would be unlikely to lead to a weakening of the other algorithms.  Of course, these algorithms do not provide the same level of security and thus may not be comparable for the desired security functionality.  </li>
<li>Applications may need to provide some type of negotiation or discovery method if multiple algorithms or message structures are permitted.  The method can be as simple as requiring preconfiguration of the set of algorithms to providing a discovery method built into the protocol.  S&#8203;/&#8203;MIME provided a number of different ways to approach the problem that applications could follow: <ul>
<li>Advertising in the message (S&#8203;/&#8203;MIME capabilities) <a href="#RFC5751" class="xref">[RFC5751]</a>.</li>
<li>Advertising in the certificate (capabilities extension) <a href="#RFC4262" class="xref">[RFC4262]</a>.</li>
<li>Minimum requirements for the S&#8203;/&#8203;MIME, which have been updated over time <a href="#RFC2633" class="xref">[RFC2633]</a> <a href="#RFC5751" class="xref">[RFC5751]</a> (note that <a href="#RFC2633" class="xref">[RFC2633]</a> has been obsoleted by <a href="#RFC5751" class="xref">[RFC5751]</a>).</li>

<h1 id="rfc.section.13">
<a href="#rfc.section.13">13.</a> <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.13.p.1">There are a number of security considerations that need to be taken into account by implementers of this specification.  The security considerations that are specific to an individual algorithm are placed next to the description of the algorithm.  While some considerations have been highlighted here, additional considerations may be found in the documents listed in the references.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.p.2">Implementations need to protect the private key material for any individuals.  There are some cases that need to be highlighted on this issue.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Using the same key for two different algorithms can leak information about the key.  It is therefore recommended that keys be restricted to a single algorithm.  </li>
<li>Use of 'direct' as a recipient algorithm combined with a second recipient algorithm exposes the direct key to the second recipient.  </li>
<li>Several of the algorithms in <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a> have limits on the number of times that a key can be used without leaking information about the key.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.p.3">The use of ECDH and direct plus KDF (with no key wrap) will not directly lead to the private key being leaked; the one way function of the KDF will prevent that.  There is, however, a different issue that needs to be addressed.  Having two recipients requires that the CEK be shared between two recipients.  The second recipient therefore has a CEK that was derived from material that can be used for the weak proof of origin.  The second recipient could create a message using the same CEK and send it to the first recipient; the first recipient would, for either static-static ECDH or direct plus KDF, make an assumption that the CEK could be used for proof of origin even though it is from the wrong entity.  If the key wrap step is added, then no proof of origin is implied and this is not an issue.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.p.4">Although it has been mentioned before, the use of a single key for multiple algorithms has been demonstrated in some cases to leak information about a key, provide the opportunity for attackers to forge integrity tags, or gain information about encrypted content.  Binding a key to a single algorithm prevents these problems.  Key creators and key consumers are strongly encouraged not only to create new keys for each different algorithm, but to include that selection of algorithm in any distribution of key material and strictly enforce the matching of algorithms in the key structure to algorithms in the message structure.  In addition to checking that algorithms are correct, the key form needs to be checked as well.  Do not use an 'EC2' key where an 'OKP' key is expected.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.p.5">Before using a key for transmission, or before acting on information received, a trust decision on a key needs to be made.  Is the data or action something that the entity associated with the key has a right to see or a right to request? A number of factors are associated with this trust decision.  Some of the ones that are highlighted here are: </p>

<ul>
<li>What are the permissions associated with the key owner?</li>
<li>Is the cryptographic algorithm acceptable in the current context?</li>
<li>Have the restrictions associated with the key, such as algorithm or freshness, been checked and are they correct?</li>
<li>Is the request something that is reasonable, given the current state of the application?</li>
<li>Have any security considerations that are part of the message been enforced (as specified by the application or 'crit' parameter)?</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.p.6">There are a large number of algorithms presented in <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a> that use nonce values.  Nonces generally have some type of restriction on their values. Generally a nonce needs to be a unique value either for a key or for some other conditions.  In all of these cases, there is no known requirement on the nonce being both unique and unpredictable; under these circumstances, it's reasonable to use a counter for creation of the nonce.  In cases where one wants the pattern of the nonce to be unpredictable as well as unique, one can use a key created for that purpose and encrypt the counter to produce the nonce value.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.p.7">One area that has been starting to get exposure is doing traffic analysis of encrypted messages based on the length of the message.  This specification does not provide for a uniform method of providing padding as part of the message structure.  An observer can distinguish between two different strings (for example, 'YES' and 'NO') based on the length for all of the content encryption algorithms that are defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a> document.  This means that it is up to the applications to document how content padding is to be done in order to prevent or discourage such analysis.  (For example, the strings could be defined as 'YES' and 'NO '.) </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.14">14.</a> Implementation Status</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.14.p.1">This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <a href="#RFC7942" class="xref">[RFC7942]</a>.

<a href="#rfc.appendix.A">Appendix A.</a> Guidelines for External Data Authentication of Algorithms</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">During development of COSE, the requirement that the algorithm identifier be located in the protected attributes was relaxed from a must to a should.  There were two basic reasons that have been advanced to support this position.  First, the resulting message will be smaller if the algorithm identifier is omitted from the most common messages in a CoAP environment.  Second, there is a potential bug that will arise if full checking is not done correctly between the different places that an algorithm identifier could be placed (the message itself, an application statement, the key structure that the sender possesses, and the key structure the recipient possesses).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.2">This appendix lays out how such a change can be made and the details that an application needs to specify in order to use this option.  Two different sets of details are specified: those needed to omit an algorithm identifier and those needed to use a variant on the counter signature attribute that contains no attributes about itself.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.3">Three sets of recommendations are laid out.  The first set of recommendations apply to having an implicit algorithm identified for a single layer of a COSE object.  The second set of recommendations apply to having multiple implicit algorithms identified for multiple layers of a COSE object.  The third set of recommendations apply to having implicit algorithms for multiple COSE object constructs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.4">The key words from <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">[RFC2119]</a> are deliberately not used here.  This specification can provide recommendations, but it cannot enforce them.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.5">This set of recommendations applies to the case where an application is distributing a fixed algorithm along with the key information for use in a single COSE object.  This normally applies to the smallest of the COSE objects, specifically COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac0, and COSE_Encrypt0, but could apply to the other structures as well.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.6">The following items should be taken into account: </p>

<ul>
<li>Applications need to list the set of COSE structures that implicit algorithms are to be used in.  Applications need to require that the receipt of an explicit algorithm identifier in one of these structures will lead to the message being rejected.  This requirement is stated so that there will never be a case where there is any ambiguity about the question of which algorithm should be used, the implicit or the explicit one.  This applies even if the transported algorithm identifier is a protected attribute.  This applies even if the transported algorithm is the same as the implicit algorithm.  </li>
<li>Applications need to define the set of information that is to be considered to be part of a context when omitting algorithm identifiers.  At a minimum, this would be the key identifier (if needed), the key, the algorithm, and the COSE structure it is used with.  Applications should restrict the use of a single key to a single algorithm.  As noted for some of the algorithms in <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]</a>, the use of the same key in different related algorithms can lead to leakage of information about the key, leakage about the data or the ability to perform forgeries.  </li>
<li>In many cases, applications that make the algorithm identifier implicit will also want to make the context identifier implicit for the same reason.  That is, omitting the context identifier will decrease the message size (potentially significantly depending on the length of the identifier).  Applications that do this will need to describe the circumstances where the context identifier is to be omitted and how the context identifier is to be inferred in these cases.  (An exhaustive search over all of the keys would normally not be considered to be acceptable.) An example of how this can be done is to tie the context to a transaction identifier.  Both would be sent on the original message, but only the transaction identifier would need to be sent after that point as the context is tied into the transaction identifier.  Another way would be to associate a context with a network address.  All messages coming from a single network address can be assumed to be associated with a specific context.  (In this case, the address would normally be distributed as part of the context.) </li>
<li>Applications cannot rely on key identifiers being unique unless they take significant efforts to ensure that they are computed in such a way as to create this guarantee.  Even when an application does this, the uniqueness might be violated if the application is run in different contexts (i.e., with a different context provider) or if the system combines the security contexts from different applications together into a single store.  </li>
<li>Applications should continue the practice of protecting the algorithm identifier.  Since this is not done by placing it in the protected attributes field, applications should define an application-specific external data structure that includes this value.  This external data field can be used as such for content encryption, MAC, and signature algorithms.  It can be used in the SuppPrivInfo field for those algorithms that use a KDF to derive a key value.  Applications may also want to protect other information that is part of the context structure as well.  It should be noted that those fields, such as the key or a Base IV, are protected by virtue of being used in the cryptographic computation and do not need to be included in the external data field.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.7">The second case is having multiple implicit algorithm identifiers specified for a multiple layer COSE object.  An example of how this would work is the encryption context that an application specifies, which contains a content encryption algorithm, a key wrap algorithm, a key identifier, and a shared secret.  The sender omits sending the algorithm identifier for both the content layer and the recipient layer leaving only the key identifier.  The receiver then uses the key identifier to get the implicit algorithm identifiers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.8">The following additional items need to be taken into consideration: </p>

<ul><li>Applications that want to support this will need to define a structure that allows for, and clearly identifies, both the COSE structure to be used with a given key and the structure and algorithm to be used for the secondary layer. The key for the secondary layer is computed as normal from the recipient layer.  </li></ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.9">The third case is having multiple implicit algorithm identifiers, but targeted at potentially unrelated layers or different COSE objects.  There are a number of different scenarios where this might be applicable.  Some of these scenarios are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Two contexts are distributed as a pair.  Each of the contexts is for use with a COSE_Encrypt message.  Each context will consist of distinct secret keys and IVs and potentially even different algorithms.  One context is for sending messages from party A to party B, and the second context is for sending messages from party B to party A.  This means that there is no chance for a reflection attack to occur as each party uses different secret keys to send its messages; a message that is reflected back to it would fail to decrypt.  </li>
<li>Two contexts are distributed as a pair.  The first context is used for encryption of the message, and the second context is used to place a counter signature on the message.  The intention is that the second context can be distributed to other entities independently of the first context.  This allows these entities to validate that the message came from an individual without being able to decrypt the message and see the content.  </li>
<li>Two contexts are distributed as a pair.  The first context contains a key for dealing with MACed messages, and the second context contains a key for dealing with encrypted messages.  This allows for a unified distribution of keys to participants for different types of messages that have different keys, but where the keys may be used in a coordinated manner.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.10">For these cases, the following additional items need to be considered: </p>

<ul><li>Applications need to ensure that the multiple contexts stay associated.  If one of the contexts is invalidated for any reason, all of the contexts associated with it should also be invalidated.  </li></ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.B">Appendix B.</a> <a href="#three-layer" id="three-layer">Two Layers of Recipient Information</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">All of the currently defined recipient algorithm classes only use two layers of the COSE_Encrypt structure.  The first layer is the message content, and the second layer is the content key encryption.  However, if one uses a recipient algorithm such as the RSA Key Encapsulation Mechanism (RSA-KEM) (see Appendix A of RSA-KEM <a href="#RFC5990" class="xref">[RFC5990]</a>), then it makes sense to have three layers of the COSE_Encrypt structure.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.2">These layers would be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Layer 0: The content encryption layer.  This layer contains the payload of the message.  </li>
<li>Layer 1: The encryption of the CEK by a KEK.  </li>
<li>Layer 2: The encryption of a long random secret using an RSA key and a key derivation function to convert that secret into the KEK.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.3">This is an example of what a triple layer message would look like.  The message has the following layers: </p>

<ul>
<li>Layer 0: Has a content encrypted with AES-GCM using a 128-bit key.  </li>
<li>Layer 1: Uses the AES Key Wrap algorithm with a 128-bit key.  </li>
<li>Layer 2: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the layer 1 key.  </li>
</ul>

<p> In effect, this example is a decomposed version of using the ECDH&#8209;ES+A128KW algorithm.  </p>
